<h1>Electing a pope</h1>
<p>On April 2, 2005 Pope John Paul II  died in Rome. He led the Roman Catholic church for more than 26 years. </p>
<p>When a pope dies there are many things that the Vatican must do before a new pope takes office. The busiest person during this period is the camerlengo, orpapal chamberlain. First he confirms the pope¡¯s death and locks the pope¡¯s private apartment. He removes the Ring of the Fisherman, which is a symbol of the pope¡¯s power. The camerlengo also organizes a meeting of the cardinals and  the election of the new pope.</p>
<p>The dead pope¡¯s body is embalmed and shown to the people in St. Peter¡¯sBasilica. Four to six days after death, the funeral takes place. The pope is buried next to others in a crypt under the main altar of the cathedral. </p>
<p>The College of Cardinals gets together to elect a new pontiff. This conclave is held in the Sistine Chapel and  starts 15 to 20 days after a pope has died.  Only the cardinals and very few other people are present. The doors are sealed and nobody is allowed in or out of the chapel until a new pope has been chosen.</p>
