A submarine is a ship that can travel under water. Military submarines are used in wars to attack enemy vessels. They are very large, up to 60 meters long. Scientists use submarines to explore the oceans and get information about plant and sea life deep under the surface.
Parts of a submarine
Submarines are often shaped like a cigar, so that they can travel quickly under the ocean surface. A submarine¡¯s outer part is the hull. It is made out of strong steel; otherwise it would be crushed by the pressure of the water. Tanks are in the hull. When a submarine dives these tanks are filled with water and the sub becomes heavier. If a sub wants to come up to the surface the water is pumped out of the tanks and replaced by air, which makes the submarine lighter.
The sail is the tall thin tower at the top of a submarine. It is the command bridge of a sub with all the instruments, antennae and periscopes which allow the captain or other crew members to see what happens on the surface.
In the decades that followed nuclear submarines carried missiles and nuclear weapons that could hit targets thousands of kilometers away. This made submarines a very dangerous weapon of war.
Today the USA, Russia and China have the biggest submarine fleets.
