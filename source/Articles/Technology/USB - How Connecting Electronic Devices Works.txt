In the later part of the 1990s the Universal Serial Bus (USB) was invented as a system of exchanging data from one storage place to another at a relatively fast speed. Today about 10 billion USB devices are in use, a figure that even stuns its inventor Ajay Bhatt from Intel. USB has become a common name everywhere, from schools and offices to hospitals.
Ajay Bhatt was annoyed by the different types of connections that a PC had and looked for a simpler way of linking different parts of a computer. He tried to set up a uniform connection system for all PC parts and other devices. Although it was difficult for Bhatt to convince computer makers that he had a good idea, he finally got the approval to change a computer's extension system completely. 
USB has many advantages. For one, a single port can control up to 128 devices at once. They powered by themselves and you do not have to switch off a device to make USB work. A USB object installs itself. Just plug it in and the computer automatically downloads the software you need to make it work.
The Intel engineer is proud of having created a standard that the computer industry has accepted and that will be here for a while to come. Today¡¯s PCs and laptops have at least 3-4 USB ports. USB connectors can be found everywhere, on printers, digital cameras, mobile phones and tablets.
