Albert Einstein was a famous scientist who completely changed the way that people saw our world and the universe. Einstein created many theories, which proved that things like gravity, light, energy and matter were connected with each other. At first, very few scientists could understand Einstein¡¯s theories but as time passed other scientists showed that he was correct.
Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany in 1879 and grew up in Munich. He wasn¡¯t a good student at school and only did things he was interested in, like science and mathematics. At a very early age young Albert started wondering about the mysteries of the universe.
Einstein decided to leave Germany and go to the United States. When World War IIbroke out in 1939 Einstein discovered that German scientists were working on a bomb that could kill thousands of people. He wrote a letter to the American president to warn him and suggested that the Americans start building one too.
According to Einstein all objects followed curved paths and get attracted by the gravity of an object. Time would pass more slowly if you are close to a very large object like a planet. This means that the clock of a plane goes faster than a clock at an airport because the plane is farther away from the earth.
