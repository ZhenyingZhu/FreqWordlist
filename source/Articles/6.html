<h1>Orchestra</h1>
<p>An orchestra is a group of musicians who play together on various instruments. Sometimes it performs alone, at other times it plays along with a group of singers. Orchestras give concerts and play for ballets or operas. They also provide background music for movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>When we speak of orchestras we usually mean symphony orchestras. They have many instruments and play mostly classical music, which is performed in concerts.</p>
<p>Some symphony orchestras have only professional musicians. The most famous are in the larger cities of the world. Among them are the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic, the Boston and LondonSymphony.</p>
<p>Orchestral music is written in the form of a score, which shows the notes that are played by each instrument. Every musician only sees the notes that he or she plays. The conductor stands in front of the orchestra and directs the musicians.</p>
<p>An orchestra can have up to 20 kinds of different instruments. Large symphony orchestras can have a hundred musicians. Smaller ones like chamber orchestras have between 5 and 40 players. They originally were small enough to play in a chamber or hall.</p>
