my_wordlist.php posting every rating in selectbox back, while the rating is generated by the information from database. Here is two problems. 1. When update, it need first post the changed rating, then get the post information and update database. While at this time the rating in database doesn't change, so it shows the original rating. Need refresh to show the right value. 2. When running in IEexplorer, it is fine, but in Chrome, when try to update the rating of after the 135th word, it doesn't change. My guess is that Chrome couldn't post that large amount of information. The solution is: 1. Using many forms to post one rating each time. 2. Finding an element in HTML that can send information back to server without refresh the page. (Seems like need ajax)
